# BlueBall64
what am i doing with my life

it is a game based on [this very terrible scratch game i made](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11400398/) a good while back - it is terrible. this is maybe a bit better and on the c64. idk. no sexual connotations.

## building
``build.bat`` on windows does the trick if you have dasm and vice (named x64) on your path. other platforms run dasm and then open the prg in vice - it autoruns!
